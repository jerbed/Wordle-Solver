## Summary Description

Reiterate the summary description of the overall goal of the project (updated as
necessary from the Proposal document).

## Checkpoint Progress Summary

Give a summary of the progress made and lessons learned thus far.

## Additional Details

- List any additional Haskell libraries required for the project (i.e., what
  `extra-deps` have been added to `stack.yaml` files and `[build-depends]` have
  been added to `package.yaml`/`<package_name>.cabal` files).
- Briefly describe the structure of the code (what are the main components, the
  module dependency structure).
- Pose any questions that you may have about your project and/or request
  feedback on specific aspects of the project.

Note: Be sure that all `.hs` source files and any supporting files (e.g.,
`stack.yaml`, `package.yaml`/`<package_name>.cabal` files, data files, examples,
...) have been committed and pushed.
