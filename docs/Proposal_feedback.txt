Weak to fair proposal.

On first glance, a Wordle application would appear to be too simple for a course
project.  Reading the proposal more carefully, a Wordle solver is a little more
challenging, but still might not be sufficient for a course project.

I don't understand the statement "The computer will suggest a list (could be
singleton) of words to guess next, then the user should indicate the actual word
chosen and the result of the guess".  Why isn't the computer making a definitive
guess, as would a human player?  Is the human an adversary (i.e., choosing the
word that reveals the least information)?  Or is the computer an assistant for
the human, suggesting possible guesses, but letting the human pick?

Is there anything interesting going on with trimming the vocabulary?  Or is it
really just a simple `filter` operation that judges each word with respect to
the information available?

Definitely think about how you will justify at the final that work that you did
for the project is of sufficient scope and challenge for a course project.


Score: 10/10
