## Summary Description

A summary description of the overall goal of the project.

## Additional Details

- One or more typical "use cases". These might include "storyboards" explaining
  how a user would interact with the program or some interesting "input/output"
  examples.
- A sketch of intended components (key functions, key data structures, separate
  modules).  To satisfy the "multiple Haskell modules" requirement, it may
  suffice to separate an application into a "model-controller" module and a
  "view" module (e.g., a "text view" module that could be replaced by a "GUI
  view" module).
- Thoughts on testing. These might include critical functions or data structures
  that will be given
  [`Tasty`](https://www.stackage.org/lts-19.20/package/tasty-1.4.2.3) tests.
- Thoughts on a "minimal viable product" and "stretch goals". Be sure to review
  the final project grading rubric and consider organizing the project around a
  core deliverable that will almost certainly be achieved and then a number of
  extensions and features that could be added to ensure that project is of
  suitable size/scope/effort.
- Expected functionality to be completed at the Checkpoint.
